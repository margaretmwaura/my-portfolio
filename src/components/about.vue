            Hi there, I’m Shubheksha! I love computers and really enjoy writing code.
            I’m particularly interested in distributed systems, how they work, their
            reliability and scalability. I enjoy breaking complex technical concepts
            and explaining them through illustrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from computers, I really enjoy reading, ferries, traveling, walking,
            classical music and crochet.

            If you have any questions or just want to chat, you can reach
            out to me on Twitter or shoot me an email.
