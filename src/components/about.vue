            Hi there, I’m Shubheksha! I love computers and really enjoy writing code.
            I’m particularly interested in distributed systems, how they work, their
            reliability and scalability. I enjoy breaking complex technical concepts
            and explaining them through illustrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from computers, I really enjoy reading, ferries, traveling, walking,
            classical music and crochet.
        </p>

            If you have any questions or just want to chat, you can reach
            out to me on Twitter or shoot me an email.
